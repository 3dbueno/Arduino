Design considerations.
======================


The original design uses Javascript.

the data are now stored in a MySQL database.

The plot webpage can already read data from the database.
(JQuery, jqplot)

PHP is needed to issue MySQL commands.



How to acquire data from the sensors or simulate data?
The problem is that the loop has to run, regardless of which web page is
currently viewed by the user.
This means that there has to be a server side script that runs, in addition to the 
web site.

How should the web site communicate with the script: We need commands such as
- start data acquisition
- stop data acquisition
- start simulation
- stop simulation
- selct IP address of sensor

The script needs to be able to store data in the MySQL database 
and communicate with the sensors through ethernet.
